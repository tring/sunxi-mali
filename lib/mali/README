This repository contains the Mali-400 proprietary libraries.

It is not for standalone use and should instead be used as a submodule
for the sunxi-mali repository, which includes a build system.

As for the r3p2-01rel1 binaries, these are actually r3p2-01rel2
binaries, but they should be compatible with even a r3p2-01rel1 kernel
side.
